# Mode of Execution Used <a href="https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Programming-in-PHP">  <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/code-stable.png" title="Visual Studio Code" alt="Visual Studio Code" width="40" height="40"> </a> &nbsp;<img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/streamlit-logo-1A3B208AE4-seeklogo.com.png" title="Streamlit" alt="Streamlit" width="40" height="40">

## Visual Studio Code
--> Visit the official website:&nbsp; <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"><img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/code-stable.png" title="Visual Studio Code" alt="Visual Studio Code" width="30" height="30"></a><br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that will be used like Linux, Macos or Windows.<br><br>
--> Follow the setup wizard.<br><br>
--> Create a new file with the extention of .py and then this file can be executed in the server.<br>

## Streamlit Server

--> Streamlit is a python framework through which we can deploy any machine learning model and any python project with ease and without worrying about the frontend.<br><br>
--> Streamlit is very user-friendly.<br><br>
--> It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.<br><br>
--> Streamlit has pre defined functions for all frontend components and we can directly use them.<br><br>
--> To install streamlit in your system, just run this command-

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Running Project in Streamlit Server
<p>Make Sure all depencies are already satisfied before running the app.</p>

1. We can Directly run streamlit app  with the following command-<br><br>
```
streamlit run app.py
```
where app.py is the name of file containing streamlit code.<br>

By default, streamlit will run on port 8501.<br>

Also we can execute multiple files simultaneously and it will be executed in next ports like 8502 and so on.<br>

2. Navigate to URL http://localhost:8501

You should be able to view the homepage of your app.

🌟 Project and Models will change but this process will remain the same for all Streamlit projects.

# About Projects
<p>Complete Description about the project and resources used.</p>

# Linear Regression Salary Prediction

--> First ML model is constructed using linear regression for the dataset.<br><br>
--> Then this model can be used directly.<br><br>
--> The Homepage is designed for steamlit app.<br><br>
--> After this the user input will be taken.<br><br>
--> Finally we can run this app in the streamlit Server and get the desired output.<br>

## Dataset Used

### Salary Dataset
--> Dataset is taken from: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression
"><img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-and-brands/512/189_Kaggle_logo_logos-1024.png" height =40 width=40 title="Salary Dataset" alt="Salary Dataset"> </a><br><br>
--> Contains Salary data for Regression.<br><br>
--> The dataset has 2 columns-Years of Experience and Salary and 30 entries.<br><br>
--> Column Years of Experience is used to find regression for Salary.<br><br>
--> Dataset is already cleaned,no preprocessing required.<br>

## Algorithm Used
<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
--> Regression: It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable. like the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.<br><br>
--> It computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. <br><br>
--> The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables.<br>

## Libraries Used
<p>Short Description about all libraries used in Project.</p>
To install python library this command is used-<br><br>

```
pip install library_name
```
<ul>
  <li>NumPy (Numerical Python) – Enables with collection of mathematical functions
to operate on array and matrices. </li>
  <li>Pandas (Panel Data/ Python Data Analysis) - This library is mostly used for analyzing,
cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.</li>
  <li>Matplotlib - It is a data visualization and graphical plotting library.</li>
<li>Scikit-learn - It is a machine learning library that enables tools for used for many other
machine learning algorithms such as classification, prediction, etc.</li>
</ul>
